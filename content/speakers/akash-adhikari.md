about : "Akash has been developing web applications and providing hands-on Python trainings to numerous young programming enthusiasts. He is currently undertaking a research based project for Kathmandu Valley’s Air Pollution analysis using deep learning methods. In the web, he likes to work with Python and Django in particular. He is a Computer Engineer from Nepal and a young researcher in the field of deep learning who has been trying to explore the infinite depths of AI. He is not an expert but a constantly hungry learner and he hopes to be so for the rest of his life."

Machine Learning (and Deep learning in particular) is solving complex computer vision, speech recognition and other "hard-to-explicitly-program" problems with an incredible and undenying accuracy. In the meantime, lots of speculations are looming around the usage and regulation of AI, as people are calling it a ‘threat’ to humanity. 

The talk basically aims to cover four things:

 - Demystifying the state-of-the-art AI algorithms (such as Neural nets).
 - The battle between "evil" AI and "good" AI (i.e Media vs Maths).
 - The present and the future of Machine Learning and Deep Learning research/applications.
 - The "ML Learning Roadmap" for enthusiasts.
