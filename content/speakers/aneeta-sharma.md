Being involved in tech industry for more than eight years now, I've worn different hats while working as a software engineer. In 2018, being a full-stack engineer does not just mean coding. There are different aspects to being a full-stack engineer other than having frontend and backend knowledge.

In this talk, I will talk about what my experiences have been while working throughout my career and what skills we need to have to become a full-stack engineer from my perspective.
